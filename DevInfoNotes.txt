2. low level and high level languages :

    low level languages:  Low-level programming languages are closer to the hardware 
    and provide less abstraction from the machineâ€™s architecture
    ex: assembly, C

    NOTE: C++ is under both low level and high level because it provides the features of both.

    high level languages: : High-level programming languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write.
    ex: javscript, python , ruby
